<h2>MI-Graph Meeting Minutes - 8-July-2013</h2>
  <p>
	<b>Meeting:</b> 8-July-2013, 6:30-9:30 at WCC BE 250 and Burger King.
	<br/>
	<b>Attendees:</b> Richard Green, Don Burnett, Jordan Martz.
     </p>


<h3>Summary of Meeting</h3>
  <p>We met to discuss an MI-Graph roadmap.
	See findings below.
     </p>
	<p>We began by identifying the intended audience for MI-Graph.
	Given that (non-professional) audience, we discussed potential offerings
	and related logistics.
	</p>
	<p>We had a "rump session" at Burger King where we discussed the history
	   of databases and technology evolution. It was enjoyed by not particularly
	   relevant to the roadmap.
     </p>


<h3>Findings</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
	<li>MI-Graph will serve a different audience from DAMA.
		Specifically, while DAMA serves a data processing professionals,
		we will target a non-professional audience interested in urban data.
	    </li>
	<li>Our audience personas include:
		<br/><b>- Hobbyist / Citizen</b> who wants to use public data in order to better understand issues of governance.
		<br/><b>- Government Employee</b> (but not a data processing professional) 
		   wants to make better use of public data in ways related to their duties.
		<br/><b>- Student Engineer</b> who wants to learn some basic techniques for working with data collections.
		</li>
	<li>Jordan has a huge repository of training content that he has written and presented 	in other contexts. 
		Some of this material can be adapted to present at MI-Graph evening meetings. 
		<br/>Also, we can lean on Jordan as a back-up should another scheduled speaker cancel at the last minute.
	    </li>
	<li>MI-Graph might serve the community by organizing tutorial events at Ann Arbor Public Library or other venues that have computer labs.
	
	</li>
	<li>WCC classrooms cannot be used for events that resemble "courses" without properly organizing them as actual WCC courses.</li>
	<li>Microsoft can generally be relied upon to provide generous support for events that feature Microsoft products. </li>
	<li>Jordan is placing some of his source code into a GitHub open source repository.
	    </li>
	<li>Don has full access privileges in the VNext MeetUp and we can use that to announce and organize MI-Graph meetings.</li>
	<li>A significant amount of ideation concerned a day-long event with a morning tutorial
	followed by an afternoon coding workshop that would encourage attendees
	to make immediate use of their newly acquired tops with urban data.
	Non-trivial databases from AATA and other agencies may be made available.</li>
	<li>Jordan owns a server where we can host content and workshops.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tentative Roadmap / Agenda</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
	<li>Define a "2013 Fall Schedule" with at least three meetings.</li>
	<li>Get agreement on monthly meeting day (e.g. Fifth Wednesdays) and location
	    (e.g. WCC BE)</li>
	<li>Make appointments with speakers for those fall meetings.</li>
	<li>Publish fall schedule via VNext MeetUp</li>
	<li>Reserve WCC BE room for those meetings</li>
	<li>Find out what is involved to make use of Ann Arbor Public Library computer labs.
	    The labs in the downtown and Pittsfield branches are very nice.
	    </li>
	<li>Design a one-day workshop that uses local urban data and some prefab templates
	    with (say) Hadoop, Python, and a visualization tool (TBD).</li>
	<li>Reserve appropriate space for the workshop with sufficient lead time.</li>
	<li>Publish workshop.</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>

<h4>Some meeting topic ideas (from e-mails and Richard) -- IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER</h4>
<dl>
  <dt>Overview of Database Design and Visualization Techniques (Richard)</dt>
	<dd>This is a conceptual class for designers, there will be no code.
	    How to use entity-relationship analysis when designing a graph database.
	    <br/>How to use simulated annealing to dynamically configure a graph visualization.
	    <br/>(several examples from the internet)
	</dd>
  <dt>How to Hadoop (Jordan)</dt>
    <dd>The Hadoop architecture and API. 
		<br/>Calling Hadoop from Python, Java, Javascript.
    </dd>
  <dt>Geographic Visualization Tools (TBD)</dt>
	<dd>Basic concepts. 
	    <br/>The Google Maps API.
		<br/>Showing MS-Excel data on a map.
	</dd>
  <dt>Statistics and What They Really Mean, and Don't (TBD)</dt>
	<dd>A brief non-mathematical explanation of terms such as average, standard deviation,
	    mean, median, mode, percentile, decile, and quartile in layman's terms.
	    How much confidence should you have in a statistic?
	    What is a confidence interval? How is it calculated?
	    How does one calculate a moving average when the data keeps moving?
	    Some handy Python libraries. 
	</dd>	
  <dt>Map-Reduce and Other Crunchy Topics (TBD)</dt>
	<dd>Map and Reduce are terms borrowed from mathematics.
	    What do they mean in (coding) practice?
	</dd>	
  <dt>Urban Transportation Planning - State of the Art (UoM prof/grad student)</dt>
	<dd>What is the state of the art for analyzing needs and potential improvements
	    in our highways, railways, and walkways?
	</dd>
  <dt></dt>
